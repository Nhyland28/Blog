    "## Problem 1: Multiples of 3 or 5\n",
    "\n",
    "*If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.*\n",

    "#### Breaking down the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's pretty straightforward. We want all the natural numbers (so positive integers... no decimals) under 1,000 that are multiples of 3 or 5. A multiple is simply \"a number that can be divided by another number without a remainder.\" So, multiples of 3 include 3, 6, 9, 12...\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we just want to take the sum of all those numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am going to create a function with 2 arguments:\n",
    "1. A list of the numbers we want multiples of (so in this case 3 and 5)\n",
    "2. The max number we want (in this case 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function will then do the following steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize a list (`sum_list`). This is where we will store the multiples of the numbers we are interested in. For the case of this problem, I mean all the multiples of 3 and 5.\n",
    "2. Loop through 1 and the `max_number` (1000 for this particular problem). We'll call this number `i`.\n",
    "3. Loop through each of the dividers (e.g. 3 and 5) and use the modulo operator, `%`, to determine if the number, `i`, is even or odd. The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division problem (e.g. `4 % 1 = 1`). \n",
    "4. If the number `i` has no remainder when divided by a divider we will `.append` (or add) it to the `sum_list` we created earlier.\n",
    "5. One problem this creates is there could be duplicates. For example, 15 would show up twice in `sum_list` as both 3 and 5 go into it. We can solve this by removing duplicates in the `sum_list`. The [`set()`](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_set.asp) function is any easy way to do this. The function converts the object into a Python [set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp) (one of the 4 major Python data classes along with lists, tuples, and dictionaries). Sets \"do not allow duplicate values\" so the use of `list(set(sum_list))` will convert the sum_list into a set, effectively dropping duplicate values, then converting it back into a list.\n",
    "6. The last step is to use the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all the multiples stored in `sum_list`."

    "This problem will involve 3 parts:\n",
    "1. Creating a Fibonacci sequence that stops right before 4,000,000\n",
    "2. Sorting out only the even numbers\n",
    "3. Finding the sum of all those even numbers\n",

    "2. And, a boolean variable determining if we want to sort even numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The function will then do the following steps:\n",
    "1. Create a variable called `modulo_div` that will allow us to toggle whether we want to sum the even-valued terms (such as in this problem) or odd-valued terms\n",
    "2. Create a list, `fibonacci`, with the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence (1 and 2)\n",
    "3. Create a variable, `i`, which will serve as an iterator\n",
    "4. Put `i` into a while loop. Then, add together the last two numbers of the `fibonacci` list and make that sum the value of `i`. For example, on the first iteration we will sum 1 and 2 making `i` equal to 3.\n",
    "5. As long as the value of `i` is less than 4,000,000 add it to the end of `fibonacci` using `append()`. If the value of `i` exceeds 4,000,000 do not add it to the list and break the loop.\n",
    "6. Once the loop is broken we create a new list, `fibonacci_portion`. Use a Python list comprehension to go through the `fibonacci` list and only add even numbers. It will be the same method we used to gather odd numbers in the previous problem (using the modulo operator).\n",
    "7. Finally, return the sum of the fibonacci_portion list (so all even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to 4,000,000) "
