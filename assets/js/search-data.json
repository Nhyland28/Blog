          "content": "My name is Nick Hyland and I work as senior data analyst for a small consulting firm that works on energy-related issues. This blog is intended to document my continuing journey into data analysis and artificial intelligence. It will include projects that focus on data analysis and cleaning primarily using Python and Pandas. I also will include projects and thoughts on artificial intelligence and machine learning as I work through fast.ai’s deep learning classes. I hope along the way some of my posts will help some other people entering the field! . I started programming in college at American University where I majored in International Studies (basically a branch of political science). While my degree is in the social sciences I learned through computer science, statistics, and research classes that I really loved working with data and writing programs. Since college I have continued to learn about data science and currently work full time as a data analyst. My work days are spent cleaning data, making dashboards and automated reports, creating and analyzing forecasts, and giving clients market insights in the form of data visualizations and written content. . Currently I am based in Denver, Colorado where I love to hike and ski. I’m also a big sports fan. Lets go Mets, Jets, and Syracuse Orange! .",
